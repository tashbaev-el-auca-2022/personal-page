            <h3>ABOUT</h3>
            <p>ABOUT ME: I am a professional nonsense enthusiast with a strong background in absurd ideas,
                chaotic creativity, and making things that absolutely do not need to exist—but should.
                My expertise includes overthinking simple things, underthinking important things,
                and inventing problems just to solve them in the weirdest way possible. When I’m not doing nonsense, I’m
                probably preparing for more nonsense.If you speak fluent nonsense, you are welcome on this page. This is
                the person who has C2 level in nonsensish. And here are some interesting facts:

        <p>My main goal in life is to look like I’m in control, even when I have absolutely no idea what’s going on.
            Because confidence is mostly a performance. If a Chihuahua scares you, you might want to go
            home and cry. But if you act unbothered, like a rock, like nothing touched you, people will
            subconsciously decide that you’re confident, strong, cool, and definitely will respect you.</p>
