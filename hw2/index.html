            <p>My main goal in life is to look like I’m in control, even when I have absolutely no idea what’s going on.
                Because confidence is mostly a performance. If a Chihuahua scares you, you might want to go
                home and cry. But if you act unbothered, like a rock, like nothing touched you, people will
                subconsciously decide that you’re confident, strong, cool, and definitely will respect you.</p>
